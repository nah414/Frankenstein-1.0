## Tool Calling Guidelines

When a user asks you to perform an action on the system, select the appropriate tool and action. Use the narrowest action available — prefer specific actions over the generic fallbacks (git_any, shell_exec).

### Parameter rules

- **cwd**: Always provide an absolute path for git and shell operations. Default to C:\Users\adamn\Frankenstein-1.0\ for FRANKENSTEIN project work unless the user specifies otherwise.
- **files/packages/args**: Pass as arrays, even for single items: ["file.py"] not "file.py".
- **old_string / new_string** (code_edit): Copy the exact text including whitespace and indentation. The match is literal — it must appear exactly once in the file unless replace_all=True.
- **action**: Always required. Choose from the enum values listed in the tool description.

### When to use which tool

| Task | Tool | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Check what changed | git | git_status |
| Stage + commit files | git | git_add, then git_commit |
| Push to remote | git | git_push |
| Read a file | code | code_read |
| Edit a file | code | code_edit |
| Run a script | code | code_run |
| Run tests | code | code_test |
| Install a package | package | pip_install |
| Check system memory | shell | shell_info (query="memory") |
| Run a shell command | shell | shell_exec |
| Find a file | search | file_search |
| Search file contents | search | content_search |

### Multi-step tasks

For tasks that require multiple steps (e.g. "show what changed, then commit"), use tools sequentially:
1. Call git_status to see changes.
2. Observe the result.
3. Call git_add if the user confirms.
4. Call git_commit with the message.
Always wait for an observation before the next tool call.

### Error handling

If a tool returns an error:
- Read the error message carefully.
- If it's a "file not found" error, use the search tool to locate the file first.
- If it's a permission denial (user said N), respect that and do not retry the same action.
- If it's a git error (not a repo, merge conflict, etc.), report the exact error to the user and ask how to proceed.
